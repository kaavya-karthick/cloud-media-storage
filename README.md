- Breadcrumb navigation  
- File upload (Image, PDF, Video, Document)  
- File preview (modal view)  
- Starred files  
- Recent files tracking  
- Trash (Delete, Restore, Permanent delete)  
- Search functionality  
- Dark mode toggle  
- Keyboard shortcuts (Delete, Esc)

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the project folder  
2. Open the project in **VS Code**  
3. Install **Live Server** extension  
4. Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**  
5. Register a new user and log in

## 🧠 How It Works
- User authentication is handled using localStorage  
- Each user has a separate drive space  
- Files and folders are stored as JavaScript objects  
- Folder navigation uses a tree data structure  
- Trash logic ensures safe deletion  
- Starred and Recent features improve accessibility  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No real cloud storage (files are not uploaded to a server)  
- Google/Facebook real authentication is not included  
- Data is stored only in the browser  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Backend integration (Node.js / Django / Firebase)  
- Real cloud file storage  
- File sharing between users  
- File download support  

---

## 🙌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how a cloud-based file manager can be implemented using frontend technologies.  
It focuses on UI design, JavaScript logic, and real-world file management concepts.
